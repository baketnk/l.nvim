lnvim is a Neovim plugin that integrates AI-assisted coding functionality into your Neovim workflow. It provides features like chat-based code generation, codeblock navigation, and seamless integration with your existing Neovim setup.

## Features

- Chat with AI to generate code snippets and assist in coding tasks
- Navigate between codeblocks in your buffer
- Send codeblocks to a specific mark for easy editing
- Customize the AI system prompt for tailored responses
- Debounce mechanism to prevent excessive API calls

## Installation

To install lnvim using lazy.nvim, add the following to your `lazy.nvim` configuration:

```lua
{
  "yourusername/lnvim",
  config = function()
    require("lnvim").setup({
      -- your configuration options
    })
  end,
}
```

## Configuration

lnvim provides a `setup` function to customize the plugin behavior. Here are the available options:

- `default_prompt_path` (string): The default path to load prompts from (default: `os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.local/share/lnvim/"`).
- `keymap_prefix` (string): The prefix for lnvim keymaps (default: `<Leader>;;`).
- `mark` (string): The mark to use for sending codeblocks (default: `T`).
- `use_openai_compat` (boolean): Whether to use OpenAI compatibility mode (default: `nil`).
- `api_key_name` (string): The name of the environment variable containing the API key (required if `use_openai_compat` is `true`).

Example configuration:

```lua
require("lnvim").setup({
  default_prompt_path = "~/.config/nvim/lnvim_prompts/",
  keymap_prefix = "<Leader>;",
  mark = "T",
  use_openai_compat = true,
  api_key_name = "OPENAI_API_KEY",
})
```

## Keymappings

lnvim provides the following keymappings:

- `<Leader>;;`: Decide with magic (chat with AI or send codeblock to mark)
- `<Leader>;y`: Set the system prompt
- `<Leader>;f`: Paste contents of a file into the buffer
- `<Leader>;j`: Go to the next codeblock
- `<Leader>;k`: Go to the previous codeblock
- `<Leader>;p`: Send codeblock to the specified mark

## Usage

1. Set up the plugin with your desired configuration using the `setup` function.
2. Use the provided keymappings to interact with lnvim:
   - Press `<Leader>;;` to start chatting with the AI or send a codeblock to the mark.
   - Press `<Leader>;y` to set the system prompt for the AI.
   - Press `<Leader>;f` to paste the contents of a file into the buffer.
   - Press `<Leader>;j` and `<Leader>;k` to navigate between codeblocks.
   - Press `<Leader>;p` to send the current codeblock to the specified mark.

## A Message From Your Local Consciousness

Hi, the above was entirely generated by Hermes 3, with some editing by me to remove references to a feature I wasn't sure shipped or not.

It's wild how good LLMs are getting. I truly hope we can own these tools as a species and not allow impossible-to-audit entities gatekeep this. With any luck, SB 1047 will make it more likely that things happen outside of California.

Find the others. The real people are out there.
