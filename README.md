![image](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/847120613/b73bed30-4aa2-4fbf-9ffc-9c870915cb38)

l.nvim is a Neovim plugin that integrates AI-assisted coding functionality into your Neovim workflow. It provides features like chat-based code generation, codeblock navigation, and seamless integration with your existing Neovim setup.

## Features

- Chat with AI to generate code snippets and assist in coding tasks
- Navigate between codeblocks in your buffer
- Send codeblocks to a specific mark for easy editing
- Customize the AI system prompt for tailored responses
- Debounce mechanism to prevent excessive API calls

## Installation

To install l.nvim using lazy.nvim, add the following to your `lazy.nvim` configuration:

```lua
{
  "baketnk/l.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("lnvim").setup({
      -- your configuration options
    })
  end,
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
    "nvim-lua/plenary"
  }
}
```

## Configuration

l.nvim provides a `setup` function to customize the plugin behavior. Here are the available options:

- `default_prompt_path` (string): The default path to load prompts from (default: `os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.local/share/lnvim/"`).
- `keymap_prefix` (string): The prefix for lnvim keymaps (default: `<Leader>;;`).
- `mark` (string): The mark to use for sending codeblocks (default: `T`).
- `use_openai_compat` (boolean): Whether to use OpenAI compatibility mode (default: `nil`).
- `api_key_name` (string): The name of the environment variable containing the API key (required if `use_openai_compat` is `true`).

The name of the api key determines which provider is used. The default is the openai-like. Anthropic has been added as of 2024-08-25!

Example configuration:

```lua
require("l.nvim").setup({
  default_prompt_path = "~/.config/nvim/lnvim_prompts/",
  keymap_prefix = "<Leader>;",
  mark = "T",
  use_openai_compat = true,
  api_key_name = "OPENAI_API_KEY",
})
```

## Keymappings

l.nvim provides the following keymappings:

- `<Leader>;y`: Yank the current codeblock
- `<Leader>;s`: Set the system prompt
- `<Leader>;f`: Select files for pasting into the prompt
- `<Leader>;j`: Go to the next codeblock
- `<Leader>;k`: Go to the previous codeblock
- `<Leader>;;`: Open/close the LLM drawer
- `<Leader>;l`: Chat with LLM
- `<Leader>;m`: Cycle through available LLM providers
- `<Leader>;r`: Replace file with current codeblock
- `<Leader>;dg`: Clear all buffers
- `<Leader>;dd`: Clear diff buffer
- `<Leader>;df`: Clear files buffer
- `<Leader>;dp`: Clear work buffer
- `<Leader>;i`: Focus main window

If you have any comments or bugs or concerns please open an issue, actively developing this for myself but if it's useful to anyone else would love to assemble something.

## A Message From Your Local Consciousness

Hi, the above was entirely generated by Hermes 3, with some editing by me to remove references to a feature I wasn't sure shipped or not.

It's wild how good LLMs are getting. I truly hope we can own these tools as a species and not allow impossible-to-audit entities gatekeep this. With any luck, SB 1047 will make it more likely that things happen outside of California.

Find the others. The real people are out there.
